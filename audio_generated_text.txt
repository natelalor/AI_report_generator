Awesome. I'm so excited, man. You have no idea if we can crack this nut, this is a billion-dollar, maybe, idea. Or at least it'll make me and my friends so happy. You have no idea. Yeah, so, it would be cool to hear more about ReShift, and then I guess we could talk more about defining the problem, too. Because in building this, we realized there's a lot of different ways to go. I guess on one end of the spectrum, there's a bunch of data streams that then get synced up into a database, and then that gets referenced to create some sort of report, and that can be either filling a template or full-on graphic design to a PDF. And then there's also, maybe you want the AI engine to do some research itself, which is something we're experimenting with, too. There was one version where you tell it you want to report on this, it goes out, it does all the research for you, and then it comes back with a report on that subject, but you haven't given it any data at all. It went and collected the data itself. Yeah, I think the core need is really just being able to have proceedings of the meeting, which is very, I mean, from what you have explained, make it as simple as you were explaining it. You feed this data from different streams into a database, and then the AI gets, and I think one part of that is to, like, one of the, then you basically say, please structure a report according to this outline, right? So that needs to be an input, is like, here's how we want the report to come out. I mean, I've never thought about, like, the graphically designed thing. That's a nice thing to have, but it's certainly not a must-have. But then what the humans are doing right now is we're looking through all that data, and we're sitting down and we're writing summaries of various different things. And then you just specify the number of pages, and you get a first draft. And, like, you know, first draft report could be the name of the product or whatever, right? You know, something like that. Or a shitty first draft would be even better. But that's kind of, you know, that's kind of in a nutshell what would be really, really cool. And then you could put all kinds of things on top of that. Like, we're doing another, we just want another project in the Dominican Republic that's going to happen next month. And it's, the workshop's going to be in Spanish, and the report has to be in Spanish and in English. You could easily, I mean, like, you don't need AI to translate, but translation could easily be part of the deliberal, right? So, yeah, that's kind of, you know, I went backwards on your agenda that you kind of presented. Sorry, someone's mowing the lawn behind me. But I think we have that right now, then. It just works off of the audio, though. So, like, you can put in a thing of audio however long. It then takes that and it turns it into a transcript. And then it condenses that transcript through a series of chunking and summaries down to, like, as large of a transcript that will fit inside of the context window. And then it uses that based on the user's, like, what they give the purpose to be for the report. They use that to create a table of contents. And then as it's writing out each section of the report, it searches the database, which is, in this case, just the audio transcript, for the specific terms that are referenced in that part of the report. So, like, that chapter, I guess. And then it pulls that context and uses it to write. How does it know when somebody's saying a particular term what context the term is being used in? In which way? It doesn't really. It just grabs, like, a huge chunk of text around it. So what it does is it takes the topic or question or whatever it's searching for and it embeds it. So it turns it into, like, this multidimensional vector space thing, which is the same space that the audio recording is stored in. And then it compares the two and sees where in the recording is it most similar to that. But there's other ways to experiment with querying that database as well. Like, you could also just do normal search where it does keywords. Yep. You could mark the transcript with specific points. Have I shared an example report with you yet? Can't remember. No, I don't think so. All right. Let me do that before I forget. I think that would be really helpful. Okay. Let's see. Here's an example. You will have to keep this confidential. I don't think it's yet public in the public domain, but... Sounds good. Let me send it to you. So do you want to hear about Reshift? Yeah. Okay. So we basically are... I mean, it's a form of rebranding. We're calling it a spin-out because we're still... We still are, as a legal entity, we are a Design Thinkers Group. And Design Thinkers Group USA is still part of this global network of other teams around the world. That do service design and innovation consulting in one shape, way, shape, or form. We kind of are rebranding because design thinking as a sort of a trend has plateaued. Thirteen years ago when I started the company, it was nascent. And even though it had been going on for a while, it just hadn't picked up steam in the mainstream of the world. And it's not dead. It's gonna go on just like other shiny objects that management follows have gone on, like Six Sigma, Agile, all these sort of methodologies that people use. But because we were called Design Thinkers Group, that was beginning to be a little bit of a ball and chain for us. People were saying, oh, they just do design thinking. Whereas we had already started integrating things like systems thinking and behavioral science and futures and foresight and Agile and various other methodologies into the work that we do with clients. And we went through a strategic planning process. Our vision is really to put people at the center of change for good. So innovation, which is kind of the label that we put on the kind of consulting that we do. Innovation is a word that means like nothing and everything. It just depends on your perspective, right? It's a buzzword. But what it really boils down to, I think, is big change. So you'll see in our branding, we talk about big change. And we talk about partnering with leaders and their teams to help them make that big change. So the leaders first have to say, yeah, we got a big problem over here. We got to solve a big challenge. And as you know, human-centered design, design thinking, systems thinking, all those kind of things are really good for those big, fuzzy challenges to help unpack them, make them more manageable to attack. So that's what Reshift is all about. It's a rebrand to get away from the term design thinking. The name is kind of nice. It's a hell of a lot easier to put into an email than design thinkers. But it's snappy and what you see is a culmination of the better part of a year of rebranded work that we've done. So it's been a busy one. Wow, well it shows. You did a really good job. We're working on our portfolio right now for my consultancy blueprint. And as part of that, we were creating vision videos with different words. I don't know exactly what to call them, but we've been calling them like word videos, where it's like motion media and it goes through different words as a way to introduce a project or a topic. Anyways, I saw that you had posted one on LinkedIn for Reshift, and so I sent it to Jayden. I was like, oh, it's another great example of a word video. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool. So yeah, we're pretty pumped. Still a lot of work to do. I call it the end of the beginning. We've got a track record. We're not leaving that behind. We're the same team. We're continuing to constantly iterate and innovate ourselves. Part of the reason we're talking, right? But it's exciting. I'm really hoping that all the effort pays off in sort of gathering or gaining the attention of the kind of people that we want to work with. And yeah, we'll see. Our designer is really, really good. She's amazing. And we just have had a really good team working on it. So I think it's really tight and crisp, and it's also very beautiful. But nobody's told me my baby is ugly yet, so I'm just waiting for that to happen. No, it's actually good. There, I'm just saying it. Oh, good. So that's cool that you did it all in-house, because I know sometimes even design... We didn't do it all in-house. We did the brand story we had help with, and then the articulation of that story, like translating the story into the various different... The voice was also a separate person that helped us to create, based on the story. We had a consulting firm help us with the story, which we had done already a lot of work on. And we gave them all of that work, and then they kind of facilitated us through a couple of workshops to get to the name and to the brand story. So I had an agency help us with that. But like I said, we did a lot. You're right. We did a lot of the work ourselves, but we also recognized at some point we needed help from the outside, because we couldn't get to a name, and we really couldn't nail the story. We needed somebody to help us, facilitate us through that process. And then translating that into a voice, which is what you read and what you see on the screen. That was both an amazing brand expert woman who helped craft the language, the voice, and then my designer who is... She's been with us for seven years. She's freaking awesome. And she did that. She conceived the visual, the layout, the design of the website, and the brand, the logo, all that stuff was her work, and really just nailed the crap out of it. Oh, cool. I still have to check out the website. I just saw the LinkedIn. Oh, really? You haven't seen the website? No, I haven't seen it yet. reshift.us Cool. And yeah, sometimes you just need someone from the outside who doesn't have the perspective of being in it. Yeah. Yeah, it's true. It's true. You get stuck. People get stuck, and that's why we exist as a firm, right? It's like people get stuck, and we help you get unstuck. We help you to shift and reshift. Yeah, exactly. Practicing what you preach by knowing when to get an outside perspective. That was one of the biggest... So there's two things. I think I might have a few years of experience on you on the entrepreneurial path. And I will tell you, those are two really big learnings for me. The facilitation, getting an external facility, paying for an external facilitator is worth... Obviously, you don't want to do it all the time. You need to do it at the right point. You can't bring them in unless you're prepared. But even before that, the biggest lesson as an entrepreneur is to learn how to spend money, how to invest money, right? Learn how to spend money. It's hard when it's your own money. Like, I remember my early days was like I was pinching every penny. And it was good to do that. I'm not saying you should spend. But to me, that's one of the most difficult things to do, to get right at the beginning, because you don't have experience doing it, right? And you don't know when to spend $100 on a monthly subscription to something. Or, you know, like I was really like stingy with my money. And I knew this whole, like, you got to spend money to make money mantra. But I didn't buy it, right? Like, and I still don't buy it. You don't do that just for the sake of doing it. But trying to figure out when to spend money and what to spend money on is really, really hard. It's not like rocket science hard, but it's like gut hard. Because I don't know, I mean, maybe you're independently wealthy. I have no idea about kind of stupid, you know, what what your your financial situation is. But for me, I'm not independently wealthy. And it was important that like, if I was going to travel somewhere to a trade show or whatever it is, it's a big chunk of change, you know, I got to make it make it worthwhile and all that kind of stuff. And I still am kind of super stingy, kind of attribute my success a little bit to that. But it's really hard at the beginning. And then related to that, one of the things we spent our money was the external facilitators. And that was kind of like, I had a guy and I knew I wanted him to help me. And he offered to help. He knew us really well. He actually works with it. He used to be at SCAD. He was a professor at SCAD. Really? Robert Bow is his name. I'm not sure. And that's how that's where I met him. I think he set up or was instrumental in setting up the master's service service design program. Cool. Yeah. So he facilitated this. He had been working. I've known him for a while. I brought him into to some some gigs from time to time. And he was between he was moving from the United States back to the UK and he had some time on his hands. And I said, hey, you want I need I'd love to have you help us. So, yeah, that was a big deal. That was the first time we got an external facilitator. And then as we started getting into the rebranding, it was like, you know, I know I need this is not something I can do. And it's not really so we started by doing it completely in-house with my designer. And then what we produced was the name was going to be. Wait for it. DTG. Right. Like, how exciting is that? Right. And I told that to people and they were to some of my branding friends and they were they were like, OK, so tell tell me, you know, what's your name going to be? And I said. DTG, and as soon as I as soon as it came out of my mouth, I was like, oh, shit, that sucks. And then and then I saw the expression on their face and they were like. Oh, don't do that. So I was like I was like that, you know, we slammed on the brakes and we said we got to we got to go back to the drawing board. And so that's, you know, we got it. We hired a firm to help us do that. They do that day in and day out. I knew what would what would be good. So it's hard. Anyway, off track. It's funny you say that about the money, though, because I ran into the same problem to like in doing the blueprint slash living persona stuff. At first, I like I did the design myself to save money. And then I hired some. Developers in India and yeah, I mean, they built it, but like spent all the budget and. Yeah, so now being much more frugal with but it's kind of. Not exactly by choice, but we're trying to do all this stuff in-house, I guess you could say. Yeah. The person I work with, brother and chat GPT wrote this. Well, I think it's good. I think it's I think it's good to spend and learn. What I will say is it all has to do with people. Right. You have to get people that get you and you're not always going to find them in the first iteration or even the second or third iteration. But identifying the kind of people that you can partner with, and I've seen it with other entrepreneurs as well, is they'll they'll hire a developer and it'll be like, you know, they're not knocking it out of the park and then they'll hire another one. And it's like, no, it's like that's different. That's not good for another reason. You know, something else isn't right there. And then they'll land on somebody that just like kills it for them. Right. Like this person is cranking out the the iterations on our on our platform, whatever it is that, you know, software development stuff as an example. But it goes for facilitators for any kind of people that you hire to or or contract to do work or you partner with. Right. Like you got to you got to make good, smart decisions about that. Yeah, it's tough. I think I probably should have been stricter on them. In the beginning. But like you said, it was the first time. So I didn't really have expectations as to what was good, what was not good. Be happy to help you if you have questions and you need any any advice. Just let me know. Cool. Thank you. It will be a while before. Well, hopefully not a while, but I'm not going to be hiring any developers anytime soon, but hopefully in the future. Well, I'm not just talking about that. I'm just talking about in general, like if you if you need some. Oh, you need a sounding board for some decision you're making or something like that, not just about spending. I've mentored quite a number of. Folks over the years, I like doing so. Awesome. I appreciate it. Thank you. I think now might be a good time. We have 23 minutes, just about of transcript. Thank you. Be a good enough test for the. I'm excited.
