## Version 1 is here, ladies and gents!
shallow_langchain_reporter is a way to turn .txt and .pdf files into an elaborate and detailed summary of the text. This uses OpenAI as our Language Learning 
Model, and Lanchain to help prepare the data and facilitate the API calls. The context window is a current problem, so your output may be 
cut off. This will be solved in Version 2, with a Pinecone backend to help provide longer sessions. Thus, it is called a "shallow" reporter.

## Usage Instructions
Download the .py file (cloning the repo, or however you may), and run it somewhere with a console window.

The only other requirement is providing it the path to a txt/pdf file as user input, then it will give you a pretty report as a result. :)

## What's next? Version 2?
You guessed it! Version 2 is next, and will be even better! The first step is audio to text implementation, which will provide users with the
ability to summarize audio. Then, it will implement a backend to provide the LLM with "memory". The output of the next version will be much more 
polished -- this one was just to make sure it worked in the most simple way. While sparing you the essay about how cool it will be, i'll say this - get excited!!
